# Peltier_driver_PID

This project is a piece of final year paper in my Engineering degree.  

This is a simple Peltier driver using a MOSFET with two relays in order to invert the current flow and control the heat/cool side:

Also to properly tune the PID, a GUI was implemented in the Arduino code in order to send/receive the PID data:
